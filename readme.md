# Knoc-Knoc-protocol
    This project implements the Knock Knock protocol in Python. The Knock Knock protocol is a simple TCP protocol used to test if a server is online. The client sends a "knock knock" message to the server. If the server is online, it will respond with a knock knock joke. The server and the client will exchange messages until the joke is finished.
